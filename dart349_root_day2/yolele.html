  <h3>Design: 7/10</h3>
  <p>The website uses vibrant colors and a hand-drawn typography to give the products a flavorful and refreshing appeal.</p>

  <h3>Usability: 6/10</h3>
  <p>The website is minimal which makes it easy to know what options are available for the user to click on. The menu displays the titles of the pages very clearly so the user does not get lost within the structure of the website. However, some interactive elements in the website do not work properly or have a delay before they start moving along with the cursor. Also, when I change the size of my window, the images which remain the same size obstruct the text which shrink in size behind them. Therefore, some the interactive elements impede the user experience.</p>

  <h3>Creativity and Content: 7.5/10</h3>
