      <h1>Research on technology addiction</h1>
      <p>
        From my personal experience, it took me a while to acknowledge that I used technology as a distraction to escape from doing “serious” tasks. At times, it would also be a way to delay my sleep time; at other times, it would be a way to avoid doing homework. There were numerous times when hours would slip by and I would be trapped inside my phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        I vividly recall one of the worst days, when I watched ten one-hour episodes on Netflix within two days and my eyes were extremely dry. Yet, I still could not peel my eyes away from the screen because there were five more juicy episodes left and I had to know the ending.
      </p>

      <p>
        The truth is, I’m not the only one who deals with this issue. The danger of social media and video platforms is that it can consume an exorbitant amount of time in our lives without us being aware of it. The reason? Because these platforms were designed to get us hooked.
      </p>

      <p>
        For my project, I want to explore the issue of technology addiction. In particular, I will address the built-in features in social networking sites (such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat) and video platforms (such as YouTube and Netflix) that promote excessive use, as well as its consequences on mental health.
      </p>

      <h2>Design Direction</h2>
      <p>
        Much like how Share the Safety’s website was a satire to the NRA, I want to create a satirical website modelled after Netflix’s website. Instead of “Netflix,” the website’s name will be “Stay.” When the user hovers over some of the headlines, the text will transition to a comment that will make the user reflect, such as, “You’ve been watching for five hours, have you eaten yet?” or “Is this episode more important than your wellbeing?” The thumbnails of the TV shows and movies will also be substituted with visuals that highlight the health consequences of excessive technology use.
      </p>


      <h2>Screenshots from Netflix:</h2>
      <p>In terms of the look of my project, I want to model the design of Netflix's interface by:</p>

      <p>Including large and simple titles</p>
      <p>Displaying bold, full-screen images</p>
      <p>Featuring mockups on mobile devices as a form of satire</p>
      <p>Having a "Frequently Asked Questions" section, where I have a question-answer format to display part of my information</p>
