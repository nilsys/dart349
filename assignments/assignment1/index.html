    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am a second-year design student at Concordia University. I love using my creativity to develop meaningful work. I am passionate about graphic design and illustration, and this passion is expanding as I am dipping my toe into the world of HTML, CSS, and Javascript (super exciting!).</p>

    <p>Unbeknownst to many, I have a background in the sciences. After graduating from Vanier in Pure & Applied Sciences, I decided to take my math and mechanics knowledge to the next level. You guessed it: mechanical engineering at McGill University. We learned about math (yay!), we learned about mechanics (double yay!), and yet… I did not feel the satisfaction or enthusiasm for studying. I felt like my days were slipping by, spent on memorizing formulas and theory without applying them in creative projects.</p>

    <!-- <h2>sub heading</h2> -->
    <p>A couple of months into the program, I decided to take a risk, the greatest risk thus far in my life (and we all know the ending --- not much foreshadowing there). I put together a portfolio and applied to the Design program at Concordia.</p>

    <p>No</p>
    <p>Turning</p>
    <p>Back</p>

    <p>I got in. It was one of the best decisions I made in my life. I’ve never been happier.</p>

    <p>In my first year in Design, I poured my heart and tears (happy tears) into so many amazing projects. I designed a children’s book recounting my experience with winter, I built a butterfly automata out of wood and metal (those big scary machines scare me no more), I constructed a cardboard chair with my friends (we named it Ben), and the list goes on.</p>

    <p>I am so grateful that in the years to come, I will have the opportunity to work on more projects and grow into a responsible and professional designer. For now, I will enjoy and take the time to appreciate riding the wave of my design education.</p>
