      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hi! I am Sharon and I am a second-year design student at Concordia University. I love using my creativity to develop meaningful work. I am passionate about graphic design and illustration, and this passion is slowly expanding as I dip my toes in the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

      <p>I have an educational background in the sciences. After graduating from Vanier in Pure & Applied Sciences, I decided to take my math and mechanics knowledge to the next level. As a result, I made the logical choice of pursuing a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. We learned about math (yay!), we learned about mechanics (oh yeah!), and yet… we did not apply it. I felt like my days were slipping by, spent on memorizing formulas and theory without bringing them to life in creative projects. I felt like something was missing in the program. Gradually, I lost enthusiasm in my studies.</p>

      <p>A couple of months into the engineering program, I decided to take a risk, the greatest risk thus far in my life (and we all know the ending --- not much foreshadowing there). I put together a portfolio and applied to the Design program.</p>

      <p><em>No</em></p>
      <p><em>Turning</em></p>
      <p><em>Back.</em></p>

      <p>And guess what? I got in! It was one of the best decisions I made in my life. I’ve never been happier.</p>

      <p>In my first year in Design, I poured my heart and tears <em>*happy tears*</em> into so many amazing projects. I designed a children’s book recounting my experience with winter, I built a butterfly automata out of wood and metal (those big scary machines scare me no more), I constructed a cardboard chair with my friends (we named it Ben), and the list goes on.</p>

      <p>I am so grateful that in the years to come, I will have the opportunity to work on more projects and grow into a responsible and professional designer. For now, I will enjoy riding the wave of my design education.</p>

      <p>This is one of my favorite quotes (source unknown):</p>
